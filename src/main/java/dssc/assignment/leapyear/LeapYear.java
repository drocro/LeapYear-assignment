/*
    Write a Java program that prints true or false depending on whether a given integer is a leap year or not.

    A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

    For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
